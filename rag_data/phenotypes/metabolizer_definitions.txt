Metabolizer phenotypes are used to describe predicted enzyme or transporter activity based on an individual’s genotype.

Normal metabolizers are predicted to have normal functional activity of the relevant enzyme or transporter based on the presence of normal function alleles.

Intermediate metabolizers are predicted to have reduced functional activity compared to normal metabolizers. This reduced activity is associated with the presence of one decreased-function or no-function allele in the diplotype.

Poor metabolizers are predicted to have little to no functional enzyme activity. This phenotype is associated with diplotypes containing two no-function alleles.

Ultrarapid metabolizers are predicted to have increased functional activity. This phenotype is associated with the presence of duplicated or multiple functional gene copies.

These phenotype definitions are used by CPIC guidelines to support interpretation of genotype results and to inform therapy recommendations.
