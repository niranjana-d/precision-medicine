Codeine is a prodrug that requires metabolic conversion to morphine to exert its analgesic effect. This conversion is mediated by cytochrome P450 enzymes.

Clopidogrel is a prodrug that requires metabolic activation to produce its active antiplatelet metabolite.

Warfarin is administered as a racemic mixture, and the S-enantiomer is more pharmacologically active and cleared primarily through enzymatic metabolism.

Simvastatin requires hepatic uptake for its therapeutic effect, and transporter activity influences systemic exposure to the drug.

Thiopurines such as azathioprine are metabolized through enzymatic pathways that influence drug exposure and toxicity.

Fluoropyrimidines such as 5-fluorouracil are primarily catabolized by dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase, and reduced enzyme activity leads to increased drug exposure.
